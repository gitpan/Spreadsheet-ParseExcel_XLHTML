NAME
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel_XLHTML - Parse Excel Spreadsheets using
    xlhtml

SYNOPSIS
            use Spreadsheet::ParseExcel_XLHTML;

            my $excel = new Spreadsheet::ParseExcel_XLHTML;

            my $book = $excel->Parse('/some/excel/file.xls');

            for my $sheet (@{$book->{Worksheet}}) {
                    print "Worksheet: ", $sheet->{Name}, "\n";
                    for (my $i = $sheet->{MinRow}; $i <= $sheet->{MaxRow} ; $i++) {
                            print join ',', map { qq|"$_"| }
                                            map { defined $_ && $_->Value ? $_->Value : "" }
                                            @{$sheet->{Cells}[$i]};
                            print "\n";
                    }
            }

DESCRIPTION
    This module follows the interface of the Spreadsheet::ParseExcel
    module, except only the "Value" fields of cells are filled, there is
    no extra fancy stuff. The reason I wrote it was to have a faster way
    to parse Excel spreadsheets in Perl. This module parses around six
    times faster according to my own informal benchmarks then the
    original Spreadsheet::ParseExcel at the time of writing.

    To achieve this, it uses a utility called "xlhtml", which you can
    find here:

            http://www.xlhtml.org/

    Get the latest developer release, I've included a patch for 0.3.9.6
    that fixes a couple minor issues, just in case. Don't apply it for a
    later version. Once compiled, it needs to be in the PATH of your
    Perl program for this module to work correctly.

    You only need to use this module if you have a large volume of big
    Excel spreadsheets that you are parsing, otherwise stick to the
    Spreadsheet::ParseExcel module.
